//Express: the web application framework in the MEAN stack
//Listens for incoming requests and will respond it can serve static files can compile html or return json data

/*%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*/

//inside app.js or main js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

/*%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*/

//you need to initialize it in order to create an application after you require it by just calling the express function as a variable

//you need it to listen to requests so its just a listen method and pass it a port to know where to listen

app.set('port', 9000);

var server = app.listen(app.get('port'), function(){
    var port = server.address().port;
    console.log("Power level is at port " + port);  
});
console.log('Me first');

/*%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*/

//you then set the app.listen method to a variable to be able to access methods and properties from this callback function 
//the var port = server.address().port allows you to access the port number without using app.get in 
//app.listen is asynchronious

//for routes we need to specify http method like a get or a post we need specify a path and specify the function we want to run when the route is found 

/*%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*/

app.get('/', function(req, res){
    console.log("GET the homepage");
});

//the function in the route usually takes 2 objects, a request (req) and a response (res)

/*%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*/

app.get('/', function(req, res){
    console.log("GET the homepage");
    res.send("This is the response youre going to get from the res.send");
});
//this res.send response.send is what you get when you get a request from the browser

/*%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*/

app.get('/json', function(req, res){
    console.log("GET the JSON");
    res
        .status(200)
        .json( {"jsonData" : true} );
    
});
//simple way to get json data with the .json

/*%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*/

var path = require('path');
//to be able to send a file instead of interpreting it on the server side you can use a native node module called path

/*%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*/

app.get('/file', function(req, res){/*%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*/
    console.log("GET the FILE");
    res
        .status(200)
        .sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'app.js'));
//use path.join tojoin in a number of different arguments to make a path

/*%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*/

//__dirname standard node variable to find the current directory ... to find our app.js
//===> this will return our app.js file onto the browser instead of our json data
    
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
//another way to define a route to static files. this adds middleware ==>
//when express receives a request for a route it will checkto see if any matches are made with the files in the folder it will deliver it to the browser without adding any routes. this will setup the public folder with the index.html and so this code here is not necessary
app.get('/', function(req, res){
    console.log("GET the homepage");
    res
        .status(404)
        .sendFile(path.join(__dirname,'public', 'index.html'));
    
});
